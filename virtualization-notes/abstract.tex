This is motivated by a desire to put things into my own words. In this virtualization research project, the end goal is
to add support for microVMs into Openstack. As of today (November 14th), we have mainly been learning and reading
various textbooks and papers over operating systems and hypervisors. Starting next week, are going to be going over OS
in 1000 lines.

This book is going to talk about both the OS and what it means to virtualize a
computer. This is because the hypervisor (which manages a virtual machine) has
to emulate hardware responses to an OS running in a virtual machine. Creating a
virtual machine is all about providing an abstraction to the OS and making sure
that things are secure and fast. Therefore, you need to know a lot about the
operating system.
