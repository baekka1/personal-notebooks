This is motivated by a desire to put things into my own words. In this virtualization research project, the end goal is
to add support for microVMs into Openstack. As of today (November 14th), we have mainly been learning and reading
various textbooks and papers over operating systems and hypervisors. Starting next week, are going to be going over OS
in 1000 lines.
